                <p>We flew into Puerto Vallarta, located in the state of Jalisco on the west coast of Mexico. This is a
                    beautiful city and a great place to begin and end a vacation.</p>

                <h2 class="outlinedheader">Sayulita</h2>
                <p>From Puerto Vallarta we traveled north by taxi to Sayulita in the neighboring state of Nayarit. Our
                    rental house was on "Gringo Hill" overlooking the town, where most of the houses are rentals for
                    tourists. This small beach town is known for surfing and fresh seafood. There are iguanas everywhere
                    (as seen in the photo below), and at night little geckos come out and run around the walls hunting
                    bugs.</p>

                <h2 class="outlinedheader">Club Playa de Camaron</h2>
                <p>One of our favorite places to enjoy a cocktail or three was Club Playa de Camar&#243n. Just north of
                    the main beach, this colorful bar offers great views of the sunset and surfers. Occasionally on
                    weekend evenings they stay open late for a lively dance party!</p>

                <h2 class="outlinedheader">San Pancho</h2>
                <p>The neighboring town of San Francisco (known as "San Pancho" for short) was also a lovely place to
                    visit. It is the next town north of Sayulita along the coast, and can be reached in about 10 minutes
                    by cab or a few hours on foot through jungle trails. This somewhat smaller town is a bit quieter and
                    less touristy than Sayulita.</p>

                <h2 class="outlinedheader">Monkey Mountain</h2>
                <p>Just south of Sayulita towers Monkey Mountain, where we went for a day hike. It can be seen in the
                    distance from Sayulita, and offers a commanding view of the area. We were actually able to see the
                    spouts of blue whales coming up for air just off the coast from the top!</p>

                <h2 class="outlinedheader">Santuario de Cocodrilos El Cora</h2>
                <p>We headed back south one day to Bucarias, a suburb of Puerto Vallarta, to visit a crocodile
                    sanctuary. This is home to several rescued crocodiles, some baby crocodiles which were hatched
                    there, and a
                    handful of other animals. It also borders on an estuary where we were able to spot one crocodile in
                    the wild! The volunteers were very friendly & knowledgeable and clearly cared a lot about the
                    animals.</p>

                <h2 class="outlinedheader">Zool&#243gico de Vallarta</h2>
                <p>After 10 days in Sayulita we returned to Puerto Vallarta for the last few days of our trip. While
                    there we traveled south of town to the zoo, where unlike any other zoo I've been to you are
                    actually encouraged to feed the animals! It's not quite as bad as it sounds: each guest is
                    issued a small bag of food at the gate containing items like bread, corn, and carrot sticks, and
                    explicit instructions as to which animals are allowed to eat each type of food. According to the
                    zookeepers they are one of the most successful zoos in the world at breeding large cats in
                    captivity, and for an extra fee we were actually able to hold some of the cubs! I'm still not
                    sure whether I agree fully with their practices, but it was a very memorable experience and we
                    were able to interact very closely with a lot of amazing animals.</p>
